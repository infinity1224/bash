 to Shell Scripting tutorial and its relevance to DevOps engineers.
02:21 🤖 Automation through shell scripting helps reduce manual tasks and streamline activities on Linux systems.
04:13 📜 Shell scripting is the process of automating day-to-day activities on Linux systems using script files.
05:32 📂 "touch" command creates files, essential for automation scripts. "ls" lists files, "-ltr" sorts by timestamp.
07:26 📚 Use "man" command to access the manual for any Linux command and understand its usage and options.
09:02 📋 Basic commands learned so far: "ls" for listing files, "touch" for file creation, "man" for accessing command manuals.
11:59 🔧 Use terminal tools like "Vim" or "VI" to create and edit shell script files.
15:01 📜 Start a shell script with a shebang ("#!") line specifying the interpreter, like "/bin/bash" for Bash scripting.
19:24 🔀 Choose the appropriate shell interpreter for your scripting needs, with Bash being a widely used option.
22:39 🚫 Be cautious of using "/bin/sh" in scripts, as system defaults might vary (e.g., "sh" pointing to "dash" in some systems). Prefer "/bin/bash" to ensure compatibility.
23:05 📄 Always use `/bin/bash` as the shebang in shell scripts to ensure compatibility, as some systems may use `dash` or other shells by default.
25:07 📝 In Linux, use the `echo` command to print text, analogous to using print statements in other programming languages.
26:47 📝 Vim is used to create and edit files in the command line. Entering "insert mode" allows you to type text, and pressing "esc" returns to command mode.
28:45 📂 The `cat` command prints the contents of a file without opening it, providing a quick way to view file contents.
29:54 ▶️ Execute a shell script using either `sh scriptname` or `./scriptname`. The latter is used for executable files. Make sure to set execute permissions using `chmod +x scriptname` if needed.
31:25 🔒 Linux requires proper permissions to execute files. Use `chmod` to assign read, write, and execute permissions for different user categories: user, group, and others. Numeric values like 777 or 444 represent these permissions.
35:09 ⚙️ `chmod` permissions follow the 4-2-1 convention: 4 for read, 2 for write, and 1 for execute. Use these values to grant permissions to different users.
37:25 🔍 The `history` command displays a list of previously executed commands, which can be helpful for referencing or repeating commands.
39:16 📂 `pwd` displays the present working directory, showing your current location in the file system.
42:10 📝 Use `mkdir` to create directories (folders), and navigate between directories using `cd`. `cd ..` moves up one directory level.
47:08 📂 PWD command for present working directory.
47:22 📁 MKDIR for creating directories.
47:37 📂 CD for changing directories.
48:20 📝 Writing a simple shell script for creating files and folders.
49:55 🗒️ Using comments in shell scripts with the "#" symbol.
50:10 💡 Shell script to create files and folders.
51:08 🔑 Using CHMOD for changing permissions.
53:43 ⚙️ Executing shell script and creating files and folders.
54:11 🌐 Shell scripting for automating DevOps tasks.
57:00 📊 Use case: Automated node health monitoring of virtual machines.
01:00:07 🧰 DevOps engineers use shell scripting for infrastructure and configuration management.
01:02:45 🔄 Use of "top" command to monitor processes and resources.
01:08:09 ⚡ Advanced topics in shell scripting, like trapping signals and cron jobs.
